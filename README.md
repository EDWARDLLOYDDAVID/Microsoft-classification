Overview
This project focuses on building and evaluating machine learning models to handle imbalanced datasets. We have explored various algorithms, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost, and LightGBM, to achieve optimal classification performance.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Custom techniques for handling missing values and feature scaling without using standard imputers or scalers.
Model Training: Implementation of multiple algorithms to compare performance.
Evaluation: Detailed classification reports to assess model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
